## Start Here

If you're new, begin with one of these paths:

- **Browse keyboard files**  
  Explore Q, Q Pro, Q HE, K Pro, K Max, K HE, V Max, and P HE models.

- **Browse mouse files**  
  Explore shell and full-model files for M and G series mice.

- **Open the files in CAD software**  
  Read the [File Format Guide](docs/file-format-guide.md) for STEP, DWG, DXF, and PDF compatibility.

- **Learn how to remix or modify a design**  
  Start with the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md).

- **See the current filesystem inventory**  
  Open the [Repository Inventory](docs/repo-inventory.md) generated from the repo itself.

- **Contribute fixes or improvements**  
  Read [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for workflow, file standards, and submission rules.

- **Join the community**  
  Join the [Keychron Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HAYbRrTsjN) to share builds, ask questions, and help grow the hardware modding community.

- **Understand the license before building**  
  Read the [License FAQ](docs/license-faq.md).

## Why This Matters

Making production hardware files available is a meaningful contribution to the broader hardware and keyboard community.

- It lowers the barrier to entry by giving hobbyists, students, and engineers real STEP and DXF files they can study, remix, and build from instead of starting from zero.
- It expands what customization can mean. With access to case, plate, and component designs, the community can explore deeper hardware changes, new materials, structural tweaks, and original variations.
- It offers real educational value. These are production-level designs, so people can learn from actual decisions around mounting systems, tolerances, and component integration.
- It helps the ecosystem grow by enabling compatible accessories, modifications, and personal projects that build around existing designs.
- It also reflects trust and transparency. Sharing internal design files signals confidence in the products and supports users as creators, not just customers.

The license is designed to support the ecosystem around Keychron products while still protecting Keychron's core hardware business. In practice, that means compatible accessories and add-ons can grow around the platform, but copying and selling Keychron keyboards or mice, or trading on Keychron trademarks, is not allowed.

## Contributing

**Ways to contribute:**
- Fix dimensional errors or tolerances in existing models
- Add ISO layout plate variants
- Improve documentation and guides
- Report issues with downloaded files

**Note:** This project is source-available with limited commercial use for compatible accessories. By contributing, you agree your work falls under the same license.

## License

This project is **source-available**. The files may be used for personal and educational work, and for commercial compatible accessories as described in the license.

**You may not use these files to copy, manufacture, sell, or distribute Keychron keyboards or mice, or substantially similar products, and you may not use Keychron trademarks as your own branding.** Commercial accessory use is allowed within the limits of the license.
