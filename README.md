## Why This Matters

Making production hardware files available is a meaningful contribution to the broader hardware and keyboard community.

- It lowers the barrier to entry by giving hobbyists, students, and engineers real STEP and DXF files they can study, remix, and build from instead of starting from zero.
- It expands what customization can mean. With access to case, plate, and component designs, the community can explore deeper hardware changes, new materials, structural tweaks, and original variations.
- It offers real educational value. These are production-level designs, so people can learn from actual decisions around mounting systems, tolerances, and component integration.
- It helps the ecosystem grow by enabling compatible accessories, modifications, and personal projects that build around existing designs.
- It also reflects trust and transparency. Sharing internal design files signals confidence in the products and supports users as creators, not just customers.

The license is designed to support the ecosystem around Keychron products while still protecting Keychron's core hardware business. In practice, original compatible accessories and add-ons are not subject to the commercial-use restriction in this license, but copying and selling Keychron keyboards or mice, or trading on Keychron trademarks, is not allowed.

## Contributing

**Ways to contribute:**
- Fix dimensional errors or tolerances in existing models
- Add ISO layout plate variants
- Improve documentation and guides
- Report issues with downloaded files

**Note:** This project is source-available. Original compatible accessories and add-ons are not subject to the commercial-use restriction in this license. By contributing, you agree your work falls under the same license.
