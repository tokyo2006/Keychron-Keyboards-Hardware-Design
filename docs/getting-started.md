# Getting Started Guide

This guide is for anyone opening the repository for the first time and wanting a simple path into the files.

## 1. Pick a Product Family

Start by choosing the kind of hardware you want to explore:
- `Q-Series/`, `Q-Pro-Series/`, `Q-HE-Series/`, `K-Pro-Series/`, `K-Max-Series/`, `K-HE-Series/`, `V-Max-Series/`, `P-HE-Series/`, and `L-Series/` for keyboard models and related parts
- `Mice/` for mouse shell and full-model files
- `Keycap Profiles/` for reference documentation about profile shapes and naming

If you want actual keycap STEP files, open a model directory that includes them, such as:
- `K-Pro-Series/K8 Pro/` for `K8-Pro-Keycap.stp`
- `K-Max-Series/K8 Max/` for `K8-Max-Keycap.stp`
- `K-HE-Series/K2 HE/` for Cherry-profile and OSA keycap STEP files

If you are just browsing, start with a single model instead of the whole repository.

## 2. Open the Reference Files First

Before changing anything, inspect what is already there:
- Open PDFs or drawing sheets for reference
- Open STEP files for the 3D model
- Open DXF files for flat plate geometry

If you are unsure which tool to use, read the [File Format Guide](file-format-guide.md).

## 3. Decide What You Want To Do

Typical use cases include:
- Studying how a production design is built
- Measuring dimensions for compatible accessories
- Remixing a case or plate for personal use
- Learning how real keyboard and mouse parts are structured

## 4. Make a Safe Copy Before Editing

Before changing any source file:
- Duplicate the original file locally
- Keep the original filename intact for reference
- Save your modified version with a clear suffix such as `-remix`, `-prototype`, or `-personal`

## 5. Check Units and Alignment

When importing or editing files:
- Confirm whether the file is using millimeters
- Check top, front, and side orientation
- Verify thicknesses, screw locations, and key cutouts before exporting anything
- Re-measure critical dimensions after converting between formats

## 6. Start Small

Good beginner projects include:
- Reviewing one plate DXF and understanding its cutouts
- Inspecting a case STEP model and identifying mounting points
- Creating an accessory that references an existing model
- Comparing two related models to see how the structure changes

## 7. Respect the License

This repository is source-available, not open source for unrestricted commercial copying.

You may use the files for:
- Personal learning
- Educational study
- Remixing and experimentation
- Commercial compatible accessories that do not copy a Keychron keyboard or mouse

You may not use the files to copy, manufacture, or sell Keychron keyboards or mice, or substantially similar products. You also may not use Keychron trademarks or branding except for factual compatibility references.

For a plain-language summary, read the [License FAQ](license-faq.md).

## 8. Contribute Back If You Improve Something

Helpful contributions include:
- Fixing documentation issues
- Reporting missing or broken files
- Suggesting clearer naming or navigation
- Sharing improvements that fit the repository rules

If you plan to contribute, follow the repository contribution guidance.
